        	<p class="about-text">The Village Pub and Café was started in the summer of 1988 when Jeff Hodges from nearby Hart Michigan who had owned and operated Provisions Sport Shop since the fall of 1982, teamed up with his soon to be brother-in-law John Perles.  John, who was working for Kodak at the time, was trying to get closer to his roots, family and Michigan State University and enjoy Saturday afternoons watching his Father, George, coach the Spartan football team. The building which originally was built as a lumber yard and later converted to a restaurant and bar known as the Boardwalk, had fallen on hard times and closed. With much determination, patience and support from their parents, family and friends Jeff and John were able to finalize a very difficult and delicate purchase agreement from the owners. The Cafe and Pub has always prided itself in being a “local” establishment offering great food, with great “local “servers, in a beautiful setting, overlooking Pentwater Lake, at a reasonable price. Much has changed in the 25 plus years since Jeff and John poured the first cold draft, yet much remains the same. From live music and comedy to friendly servers happy to take care of you, the Café and Pub is still a great place to catch a game, enjoy a steak, salad, some seafood, or have a nice cold beverage. Whether you’re in town for one of the many festivals or events or in town to relax this is still a great place to unwind and have some fun with old friends or make some new ones!</p>
