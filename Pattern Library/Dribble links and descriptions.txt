1) I thought this one was hilarious due to the fact that the AppleLive event is taking place and also due to the fact that 
   Apple's prices, in my opinion, are outrageous.

2) I thought the still of this looked really cool by itself, but when I clicked on it and saw that it was animated I liked
   it even more. It just looks really clean and appealing to me.
3) I really like the contrasting colors in this one, how the dark colors all around the image really make the center look 
   like it is glowing.
